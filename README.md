# Match Fees Tracker

A tool to help amateur sports clubs easily collect and manage match fees. Collecting fees after a game is often an admin headache — some players have already left, some head to the pub, and others go straight home to their families. Match Fees Tracker makes it simple to track payments without the chaos.

Once the core Python logic is proven in the terminal, the next step is to generate secure payment links that can be easily posted into WhatsApp team groups. These links will also track which players have paid and highlight those who still owe.

In future, the system could even send automatic reminders to players who haven’t paid, saving team admins even more time and hassle.

The app is especially relevant for grassroots sports such as cricket, hockey, football, and rugby — where players typically pay small match fees per game (or even for some practices) to cover costs like teas, referees, new match balls (in cricket), and lighting costs (for hockey on astroturf at night).
