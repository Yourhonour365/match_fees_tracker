# Match Fees Tracker

A Python tool to help amateur sports clubs easily collect and manage match fees. Collecting fees after a game is often an admin headache ‚Äî some players have already left, some head to the pub, and others go straight home to their families. Match Fees Tracker makes it simple to track payments without the chaos.

## Features

- **Simple fee tracking**: Keep track of who played and who has paid for each match
- **Terminal-based interface**: Easy to use command-line tool for quick fee management
- **Match data persistence**: Store match information and payment status
- **Player management**: Track regular players and their payment history

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Python Logic ‚úÖ

- üó∏ Basic match and player data structures
- üó∏ Terminal-based fee tracking
- üó∏ Data persistence (JSON/CSV export)
- üó∏ Payment reporting and summaries

### Phase 2: Payment Integration
- [ ] Generate secure payment links for easy sharing
- [ ] WhatsApp-friendly link format for team groups
- [ ] Real-time payment status tracking
- [ ] Outstanding payment highlighting

### Phase 3: Automation
- [ ] Automatic payment reminders
- [ ] Email/SMS integration
- [ ] Team admin dashboard
- [ ] Payment history and analytics

## Target Sports

This tool is especially relevant for grassroots sports where players typically pay small match fees per game:

- **Cricket**: Teas, match balls, ground fees
- **Hockey**: Astroturf costs, lighting, equipment
- **Football**: Referee fees, pitch hire, equipment
- **Rugby**: Ground maintenance, match officials, kit

heroku create your-app-name

# Deploy to Heroku
git push heroku main

# View your deployed app
heroku open
```

**Required Heroku files:**
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Procfile` - Tells Heroku how to run the app
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python version (optional)

## Usage

### Local Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

### Deployed Version
Visit your Heroku app URL to use the web interface (coming in Phase 2).

## Match Data Structure

Each match is stored as a Python dictionary to keep all details about a match in one place:

```python
match = {
    "id": "unique_match_id",
    "opponent": "ewhurst",
    "date": "2025-09-25",  # ISO format for better sorting
    "venue": "home",       # "home" or "away"
    "fee": 5.0,
    "players": [],         # list of player names/IDs playing in the match
    "paid": [],           # list of player names/IDs who have paid match fees
    "created_at": "2025-09-11T10:30:00",
    "notes": ""           # optional notes about the match
}
```

## Player Data Structure

```python
player = {
    "id": "unique_player_id",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@example.com",  # for payment links and reminders
    "phone": "+44123456789",      # optional
    "matches_played": 0,
    "total_fees_owed": 0.0,
    "total_fees_paid": 0.0,
    "payment_history": []         # list of payment records
}
```
